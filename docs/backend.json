    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to accommodate the entities and features described in the request, focusing on simplicity, security, and scalability. The structure leverages structural segregation, path-based ownership and denormalization to ensure authorization independence and efficient data retrieval. It's crucial to note that given the information available from the request, the data structure is designed to accommodate the described UI elements.\n\n1.  **Clients**: Stored in a root-level `clients` collection. This allows for easy listing and management of clients. Security rules would typically restrict write access to authorized admin users.\n2.  **Services**: Similar to clients, services are stored in a root-level `services` collection for straightforward access and management. Admin roles would govern write access.\n3.  **Funnel Steps**: Funnel steps, like services and clients, are stored in the root-level `funnel_steps` collection. Admin roles would govern write access.\n4.  **Contact Form Submissions**: All contact form submissions are stored in a root-level `contact_form_submissions` collection. Because these are unauthenticated submissions, security rules will ensure only write operations are permitted, limiting the risk of data injection or manipulation. A server-side function could process these submissions further.\n\nThis structure is chosen to enable simple and secure security rules, fulfilling the QAPs by segregating different data types into their own collections.  Authorization Independence is achieved as writes are independent, and reads are collection-based and do not require dependency on other documents."
